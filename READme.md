# Requirements

- 🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
- 🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
- 🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
- 🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
- 🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

# Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.
- 🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.
- 🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.
- 🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.
